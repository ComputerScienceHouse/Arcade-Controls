CSH Arcade Controls
==================

Chris Lockfort (devnull@csh.rit.edu)

A USB joystick emulator for CSH's arcade controls.

Based on some open source code from grunskis for USB joystick stuff on AVR/Teensy board, which was in turn based off PJRC's USB keyboard HID device code for Teensy boards.
I've adapted it to add a ton of new buttons, new axis, new HID descriptor, new AVR chip type to accomodate expanded pin count need, etc.
