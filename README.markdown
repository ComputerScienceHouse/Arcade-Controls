DIY ARCADE GAMEPAD
==================

This project is my first attempt in creating USB powered arcade game
controller. Its going to use Seimitsu LS-40 joystick & two Sanwa
push-buttons. 

I'm not going to use Arduino for this project since it
can't act like HID device by default. [Teensy][2] is new Arduino-like
development platform that can emulate any HID device.

To build this project you'll need [CrossPack][1].

I got inspiration for this project from this blog [post][3]. 

Next step is to build some good looking game pad enclosure like
this [Idiot Box][4].
