DIY ARCADE GAMEPAD
==================

This project is my first attempt in createing USB powered arcade game
controller. Its going to use Seimitsu LS-40 joystick & two Sanwa
push-buttons. 

I'm not going to use Arduino for this project since it
can't act like HID device by default. Teensy is new Arduino-like
development platform that can emulate any HID device.

To build this project you'll need [CrossPack][1].
